Today, I partnered with Zach for the whiteboarding exercise. 

### Process Overview

* Read over the problem with a partner.
* Click 'Run Sample Test' to see bugs:
* Determined that code was only replacing the first character with a '-' and not any of the dots.
* Find docs for .replace method and go over proper syntax.
* Found possible solutions in docs to test. Experimented with those and performed tests along the way.
